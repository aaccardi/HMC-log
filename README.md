## HMC-log

This is a log and sharing space for the Hadron Mass Correction research group at HU and their friends.

Main components:
* **e-log for meeting and activities** 
The central tool here will be the **[Git Issues](https://github.com/aaccardi/HMC-log/issues)**, that you can access from the tab on top, left of this page. We will use this to log the minutes of our meetings and to share and discuss our progress. This is meant to be a permanent record of discussions, as opposed to our Slack channel, which is more of a chat.
* **Other**
For now nothing else, but at some point we may want to also include here folders with the Juoyter notebooks or other code we develop as a cewntral repository for everybody. Or a wiki, or anything else we'd come up with.

Enjoy!
